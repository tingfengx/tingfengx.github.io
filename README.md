# My Personal Website
Building my personal website using github pages with github minimal template, availavle here: https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal. The purpose of this project is to remind myself of html programming and at the same time build a small personal webpage!

## Some small web apps written by me are hosted in this repo too.
- The [GPA calculator utility app](https://tingfengx.github.io/utils/gpacalc/gpacalc.html) that I find useful once in a while.  The one on acorn loads a bit slow outside of Canada, so I made this.
